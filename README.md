The Odin Project Foundation, landing page project. Making a personal page based on the lesson I learned.

30th jan, adding and making initial html, css and image file for the main website. This is of course will be the last time I
edit the repo because this is just an exercise and I finished it. Just making sure i get accustomed to the habit of updating the readme file. In case anyone decide to read this lol.
